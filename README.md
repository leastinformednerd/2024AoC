# 2024 Advent of Code
My solutions for 2024's Advent of Code

### Day 1
> Part 1 time = 14:55, Rank 5629

> Part 2 time = 15:55, Rank 4413

>(Probably worse than it needs to be I spent maybe 12ish minutes on a compiled Haskell solution but I am not good enough for it rn)

1.repl.py is just the entirety of my repl for day 1
1.repl.cmd.py was generated by grep ">>>" 1.repl.py >> 1.repl.cmd.py and contains just the code I ran

A better python solution is probably (given that itertools has been unqualified imported and that input is in `text`):
\>\>\> t=list(batched(map(int,text.split()),2))

\>\>\> l,r=[q[0] for q in t],[q[1] for q in t]

\>\>\> sum(abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(sorted(l), sorted(r)))

And for part two we can repeat

\>\>\> sum(a*count(a,r) for a in l)
